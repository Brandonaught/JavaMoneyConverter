# JavaMoneyConverter
This java code was compiled using QtCreator. Computed change so that it will compute change for the "old style" British money (Pounds, Crowns, Shillings, Six pence, Three Pence, Pence, Half Pence, and Farthing). This code assumes that there is no tax, and that Pound notes come in 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 denominations.
